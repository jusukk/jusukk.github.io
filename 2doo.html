                During my internship, I developed a procedural 2D-door generator for Latchback Games' Break the Beyond
                game, a roque-like card game. The generator was created in Adobe Substance 3D Designer and can be easily
                used with Adobe Substance Player. The doors were used to let players choose the next area
                and there needed to be multiple different variations.
                <br><br>
                The generator produces variations of door sprites according to theme. It has a base model that acts as
                the main frame for themes to add more details to it. This allows changes to be made to the door, like
                making the doorway bigger, and it will update all themes with the changes and keep them unified. It
                initially had simple box-style buttons for doors, but later evolved to door-shaped buttons for better
                recognition.
                <br><br>
                Problem with this generator is that generated doors lack personality and recognition. They look the
                same. This can be fixed by adding details manually or updating themes to generate more personalized
                details.
