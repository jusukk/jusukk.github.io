                Procedural 2D-doorgenerator created for Latchback Games during my internship. They were developing their
                new game Break the Beyond which was a Roque-like card game where you played against randomly generated
                waves of enemies. The player had different heroes and collectable items that could be combined with each
                other to create more powerful versions. The game levels consisted of rooms with hordes of enemies
                followed by a boss fight. The player got a reward after they completed the room. After this, the player
                had to choose the next room from the three options and start the process again.
                <br><br>
                The game used the Unity game engine and was developed for Android for the Google Play store. It was 2D
                and used a vector-like style. It had several different themes for the rooms, which affected the
                quality of the enemies and the background of the room.
                <br><br>
                My task was to design and make a procedural generator that could create a large number of unique door
                sprites. It also had to be easy to use and expandable so they could use it after my internship ended.
                The generator was created in Adobe Substance 3D Designer and it could be used easily with Adobe
                Substance Player.
                <br><br>
                First idea was to create simple box-style buttons for doors that would have different frames.This was
                later changed to be more door shaped for better recognition. They also needed to be more vector stylized
                which was an interesting challenge to create in Adobe Substance 3D Designer.
                <br><br>
                Themes were dungeon, mountain and snow mountain. Themes could be easily created by using a base model.
                Each theme also shared the same door shape for better unity and recognition. These were created in a
                subfile, so any changes made to them were applied to all the themes.
                These were early concept sprites and they needed to have more recognizable details that would give them
                more personality and make them easier to remember. This could be done manually or procedurally in the
                generator.
