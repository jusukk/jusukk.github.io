                Prototype of a 2D platformer that I made in 2 months. It had a set of rooms that were randomly selected from
                the pool. Each room had a different type of environment, set of enemies, and obstacles. The player's
                goal was to get through the rooms as fast as possible and get the highest score. Defeated enemies
                dropped orbs that could be collected for points.
